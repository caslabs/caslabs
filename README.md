All my pins are real world apps i've made since my middle school days. All are hackathons wins (+ an international award), software i've wrote as a ~15yo, and innovatin my local communities. _Mementos_ and _mantra_ and what not

If you want to see my clean code, benchmarking, design patterns, efficient software systems (DevSecOps), _yada yada,_ then go to https://jeraldy.com/projects where i discuss my mythica-mothman-like experiences starting as a ~17yo pulling all-nighters and nourishing myself with a brewed drink to keep myself awake at 4 am in the morning as pitch day begins less than 7 hours [1]
